    """
    Draws samples from the prior distribution of a given PyMC distribution.

    This function creates a PyMC model with a single variable, drawn from the specified
    distribution, and then samples from the prior of this distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dist : pm.Distribution
        The PyMC distribution from which to draw samples.
    num_samples : int, optional
        The number of samples to draw from the prior distribution. Default is 10,000.
    seed : int or None, optional
        The seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility. If None, 
        the results will vary between runs. Default is None.
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to the distribution constructor.
        e.g. sigma for Normal, alpha and beta for Beta.
        See PyMC Distributions for more info: https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/stable/api/distributions.html

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        An array of samples drawn from the specified prior distribution.
